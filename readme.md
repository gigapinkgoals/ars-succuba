# Ars Succuba

## About
This project spawned as a random idea within the Buxom Euphoria Telegram group as a book of "pink sayings" - a list of wise, yet lustful sayings for those who wish to look more than their best for the attraction of everyone.

## If this was written by a group, why is there 'one author'
Mainly to keep in line that this book is a work of fiction. Candace Blake serves as the pen name for all of us to use.

## How to contribute
Fork this project. Clone your fork. Add your changes to the `ars-succuba.md` file. (We use [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org/help/) to markup. Metadata is in Pandoc Markdown format). Push your changes to your fork. Make a pull request. If your changes fit, we will merge.

## How to build
Within the 'make-scripts' folder, there will be a `linux.sh` and a `windows.bat`. You will need to install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and either [TeXLive](http://tug.org/texlive/) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/). Once these are installed, then you just need to run the file of your choice and it builds it on the spot
